       <p>Hi, I’m Hoa Nguyen, a computer science major with a passion for coding and all things tech. 
           My journey into CS started with a childhood curiosity about how gadgets worked (and plenty of trial-and-error experiments!). Today, I love the creativity and problem-solving involved in programming, whether I’m building websites, debugging a tricky issue, or exploring algorithms. I’m particularly excited about web development and artificial intelligence, as I see them as gateways to shaping the future in meaningful ways.</p>
    <p>Outside of my studies, I enjoy blending my love for technology with my other interests. 
        I spend my free time working on personal projects, experimenting with new programming tools, and learning from the tech community online. Beyond coding, I find balance in cooking new recipes and planning travel adventures. For me, computer science isn’t just about writing code—it’s a way to create, innovate, and connect with people worldwide.</p>
